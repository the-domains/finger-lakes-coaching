Life was not perfect at 12 Bear Street, but it was close.   I thrived with my extended family close by and a community of friends who provided a loving extension to my family. I went on home visits with my mother as a preteen, when she worked for the Dept. of Social Services.  I tagged along with my father when he did free plumbing work for elderly people who could not afford to maintain their homes.  I was trained early by my family, church, and community in a life of service to others.  I was a three sport athlete, in choir and played french horn in Lyons Central School.  My senior year of high school I arrived early all spring to play and say goodbye to the french horn. In college, I focused on wrestling, leaving my music and other sports interests behind.  I wrestled for three years in college and cemented being a wrestler as part of my core identity.  I was a county champion and co-captain wrestler in high school, the first freshman on SUNY at Oswego varsity and third in New York State as a sophomore.  I accomplished less than I could have on the mat, however I took on the character traits of a wrestler into my adult life. I was happily married for 13 years and we were blessed with two children:  Meghann and Brian.  I was devastated by our marriage failed and created a story of suffering which undermined my life for to long. My first career was in Child Protective Services.  For 29 years I worked on the dark side of life.  I sought out the most evil and disfunctional parents I could find and attempted to change or control their ability to harm children.  Everyday of that work:  I feared the death or demise of children and gave my all.  I used my fear to excel for a long time. At 52 years of age I was burned out in life;  burdened with post traumatic stress from my work, failed personal relationships, the pain of my father’s debilitating alzheimers, followed by his and eight other deaths within 8 months of people I loved.  I reached a breaking point.  I stood in the doorway of death and the door was wide open. I was able to survive six more months until I could retire from CPS.  In January 2003, I began a healing journey that still continues to this day. My first 6 months of retirement I studied Dr. Phil’s books and applied his lessons to myself.  Next I lost 100 lb. in 8 months.  My healing had just begun.  Over the past decade I have healed the suffering in my life and can feel the pains of life in a more healthy manner.  I have rephrased the story of my life to one more consistent with love and acceptance. I am now on a path to thrive and excel in life again.  I have had some great moments of thriving before, however the integration of my life experiences present a special time for me now. October 2011, I was diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder and began to study for my Coaching career.  For me untreated ADD  and PTSD explained the suffering I had accumulated in my life, as I had attempted to achieve my highest goals.  My personal growth over the past two years has presented me with an opportunity to return to a life of service at a whole new level. In coaching I find the rewards of personal service, and I love working on the bright side of life.  The lessons I learned working in pain, trauma and death have armed me with great knowledge and skills to help others.  The lessons I have learned in healing my suffering have reopened my ability to thrive in life.  I am incredibly grateful for the blessings of love and connection that have been so freely showered on me so far in my life.  I am grateful for my continuing chance of a life of service to others.  I am grateful for the love and support of my family and friends as a great sense of wellness fills me today. Winters in my life; Big Bart dieing, betrayal, refusing to love, emotional eating, when CPS was a hostile work <a href="http://environment.My" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environment.My</a> thriving depends on;  Meditation, education, diet, exercise, and medication for my ADD.  Journaling, loving and connecting with others in order to thrive.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">Finger Lakes Coaching</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
